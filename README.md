# Technical Test - Documentation

### Technologies used:

1. **HTML5**

2. **SCSS/SASS**

3. **React**

4. **JavaScript**

### How I did it:

1. **Downloaded the assets from the attached Adobe Xd file**

2. **Implemented the fonts used with google fonts and placed the link tag inside of index.html in the public directory**

3. **Created a react app on Visual Studio Code and installed node-sass dependancy**

4. **Inside src folder, created a partial scss file for variables - helpful when a project scales up so it's easier to maintain or make changes**

5. **I used React because it offers a better and more organized file/folder structure.**

6. **Inside card component I created an article tag - hypothetically the card is rendered inside a section (cc App.js file)**

7. **I used BEM convention for class naming**

8. **All sizes, weights and spacing are based on original design**

9. **Final build is hosted on Netlify**
